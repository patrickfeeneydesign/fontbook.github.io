                <p>Adobe Jenson Pro captures the essence of Nicolas Jenson’s roman and Ludovico degli Arrighi’s italic typeface designs. The combined strength and beauty of these two icons of Renaissance type result in an elegant typeface suited to a broad spectrum of applications. Designed by Robert Slimbach of the Adobe type design team, Adobe Jenson Pro is part of the family of Adobe Originals historical revivals, including Adobe Garamond Pro and Adobe Caslon Pro. With its many OpenType features, extended language support and typographic refinement, Adobe Jenson Pro provides a power and flexibility for text composition rarely found in digital type.</p>

                <p>Originally drawn in 2005 by Joshua Darden and expanded several times over, the Freight collection of typefaces is renowned for its historical innovation and ongoing popularity. As Jan Middledorp put it in Shaping Text: “with the Freight suite, Joshua Darden took a radical approach to designing for optical size. Letterpress’s subtle difference between the various body sizes have been translated into boldly drawn, hugely different variants with pronounced size-related characteristics. Freight turns the traditional ‘natural’ gradations of contrast and width into a conscious stylistic device.” Joshua Darden would be one of the smartest and most interesting people you’d ever met — if you ever met him. Though he has received much critical acclaim, he’s been variously called, “a silent hunter”, “a hermit”, and “mythic”. He founded this studio in 2004, establishing a strong brand of critically acclaimed retail font families.</p>
